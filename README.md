# Bite Size

Bite Size is an Android application, built using Java and Firebase, that gathers online food businesses (example: https://www.instagram.com/yugosushibake/) into a central platform. Current problem is there doesn't exist a central place to find these small businesses (unlike Yelp), and they're hard to find outside of social media and word of mouth. This is our solution to that problem.
